<h1 align="center" id="title">Eye Disease Classification</h1>

<p id="description">As we are living and growing with artificial intelligence around us. AI is also useful in the detection of many diseases. So we are here with three different eye diseases which will be detected from optical coherence tomography images using Deep Learning and transfer learning techniques. we will be using VGG19 resnet mobile net with CNN. Eye disease are very serious but only opthamalogist can detect it clearly So here we are trying to detect three disease using the data provided by the university of californiasan diego. There are 84564 images containing all test train and validation. Then the main model is discussed in methodology. The image is taken as input in web application and detection is predicted.</p>
